I was awarded the Excellence prize (1srt place) by the Réseau des Etudiants Nigériens en France (RENIF).

In 2019, I applied for the first edition of the RENIF Excellence prize award which rewards the best Nigerien students in France. Surprisingly with my double curriculum in engineering and master of science in which a had the major's grade respectively 15.44 / 20 and 14 /20, my application was accepted and more surprisingly a had the first place.

This was one of my best day ever!

Here a copy of my certificate:
