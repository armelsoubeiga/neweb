Group school project on the development of a software in C.

In this school project in group, we developed a strategic game (Repello) in C from the top-down analysis to an interface in a terminal.

The Structured analysis report (in French) is available [here](/files/Cahier_des_Charges_du_Projet_d_Algorithme.pdf)
