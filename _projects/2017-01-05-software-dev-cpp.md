In this school project in group, we developed a software from the UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams to a GUI (Graphical User Interface), that creates cars using geometrical forms (circles, triangles, etc...) and moves them given a direction.

The main programming languages and packages used are: UML, C++, Qt.
