Individual school project on dimensionality reduction technics.

The goal of this project was to get familiar with dimensionality technics: PCA (Principal Components Analysis), LLE (Locally linear Embedding), TSNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), LEM (Laplacian EigenMap) and auto-encoders, and to compare them on several datasets.

The main programming languages and packages used are: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow.

The report (in French) is available [here](/files/Rapport-projet-GMM-DJIBEROU.pdf).
