I'm pleased to announce that on September 17th, I defended my Ph.D. thesis in computer science and machine learning and became a doctor of university of Clermont Auvergne. This is my history!

I'm 27 years old, from Niger, the firstborn of my family and I have five sisters. My mom got married at 18 and left school. She was about to attend high school. My dad joined the army in the 80s. He also didn't have to chance to go to university. The earnings of my parents since I was born to now have been less than 800 EUR/months.

In 2012, when I had my baccalaureate at the high school of Excellence of Niamey (a public high school that recruits the best students around the country), my dad wanted me to become a medical doctor, however, I knew that this path will not fit because my passion has been for mathematics. I decided to follow the latter path. With my baccalaureate results (see Image 1, overall grade 15.5/20 with 20/20 in mathematics by solving all problems two hours over the fourth given), I received scholarships from the governments of Morroco and Niger and went to Morroco to study mathematics, computer science, and physics for three years. I discovered for the first time computer science programming during this curriculum and fell in love with it.

Despite having several privileges in Morroco (university and accommodation fees were almost free), the social context was difficult due to my skin color.

In 2015, I specialized in applied mathematics and wanted to become an engineer. To that end, I applied to several engineering schools in France and got selected without passing the exams. One of the schools that accepted me (Sup Galilée) is based in Paris, however, I couldn't afford the living cost there. I decided to go with Polytech Clermont and became an applied mathematics engineer three years later. During the last year of my curriculum, I had the opportunity to do a double curriculum in research master in computer science at lSIMA Clermont-Ferrand (I had classes from Monday to Wednesday at Polytech and remaining days at ISIMA). To validate both degrees, I did a research internship at LIMOS Lab. With my degrees results (engineering 15.5/20 and research master 14/20), I was awarded first place of the Excellence prize organized by an association of Nigeriens in France (see Image 2).

During my internship, I got a Ph.D. funding (105 000 EUR) for three years from the french national agency of research. Before the validation of the funding, I applied for a Ph.D. thesis offer with 18 000 $ CAD/year from Université Laval and got selected to fill the position among candidates around the world (see Image 3). I remember having 615 EUR in my bank account from the earnings of my internship and neither my parents nor my relatives were able to help me move to Canada. In the meantime, the Ph.D. funding in France was confirmed and I had the opportunity to do three years of amazing research in multidisciplinary fields.

During my second year of the thesis, my co-supervisor in Canada proposed a post-doc to me to continue working with him after my Ph.D. graduation. At the same time, I had a machine learning scientist offer from Prevision.io. The latter company insured me that the position will be kept until I finish my Ph.D. I choose to go with Prevision.io and will start the position next week.

My journey in France wouldn't be possible without the french government's housing assistance for foreign students and almost free of charge of universities. In addition, I was able to do food deliveries (sometimes 11 hours per day and despite the weather conditions, see Image 4) to earn some money from which I paid my charges and sent some parts to Niger to support my family.

Before leaving my family, my main goals were twofold: always follow my passion and show particularly to my sisters and anyone in my situation that no matter hard it will be, especially having financial issues, hard work will always pay off. One of my sisters came to France last year for her studies and it's satisfactory for me to achieve both goals!

My philosophy is dreaming big and putting the necessary efforts to achieve them! The sky is not my limit, but the universe is! The Ph.D. is a step among others in the path I choose for myself, and the best is yet to come!
